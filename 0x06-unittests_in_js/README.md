# JavaScript Unit Testing Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use unit tests in JavaScript with tools like Mocha, Chai, and Sinon. The goal is to write robust tests for various JavaScript functionalities, including asynchronous functions, using spies, stubs, and integration tests for a Node.js server.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Use **Mocha** to write test suites.
- Implement assertions using **Node** and **Chai**.
- Write organized test suites, even for larger projects.
- Utilize **spies** and **stubs** for mocking in tests.
- Understand the usage of hooks (`before`, `after`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`) in tests.
- Write unit tests for **async functions**.
- Write integration tests for a small **Node.js** server.

## Requirements

- All code will run on Ubuntu 18.04 with Node.js 12.x.x.
- Supported editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, Visual Studio Code.
- All files should have a `.js` extension.
- Ensure all files end with a newline.
- A `README.md` file (this file) is mandatory at the root of the project.
- Tests should be executed using `npm run test *.test.js` without any warnings or errors.
